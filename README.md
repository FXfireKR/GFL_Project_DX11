## Effect Management Class
 To use the Effect, we've finished creating a class using MemoryPool!
At the start of the battle, the instantaneous frame drops will be relatively small, 
since we will pre-allocate the maximum required. Several changes have been made to the LoadManager 
and ImageManager to be compatible with EffectManagement.
